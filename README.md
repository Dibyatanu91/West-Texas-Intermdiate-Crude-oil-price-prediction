# West-Texas-Intermdiate-Crude-oil-price-prediction
In this project, I used the deep learning knowledge of recurrent neural network (e.g. LSTM, GRU, etc.) and feed forward neural network (dense layer), to perform time series forecasting for WTI crude oil prices. And from the prediction given by the models, to provide business insights for the crude oil industry.
